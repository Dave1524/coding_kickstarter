    Generate 3-4 clarifying questions that will help you create a detailed setup guide. Focus on:
    - User's technical level and experience
    - Key features and functionality needed
    - Data storage requirements (if any)
    - Authentication needs (if any)
    - Deployment preferences
    - UI/UX expectations

    Return ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:
    {
      "questions": [
        {
          "id": "unique_id_1",
          "text": "Question text here?",
          "type": "text",
          "placeholder": "Optional placeholder text"
        },
        {
          "id": "unique_id_2",
          "text": "Another question?",
          "type": "select",
          "options": ["Option 1", "Option 2", "Option 3"]
        }
      ]
    }

    Rules:
    - Use "text" type for open-ended questions
    - Use "select" type when specific options would be helpful
    - Keep questions concise and beginner-friendly
    - Generate exactly 3-4 questions total (not 5)
    - Make questions specific to the project idea
