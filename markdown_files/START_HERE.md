## 💡 Key Concepts (Explained Simply)

### **Next.js**
Your web app framework. It's like a template system that makes building websites 10x faster.

### **TypeScript**
JavaScript, but safer. It catches your mistakes BEFORE they break your app.

### **Tailwind CSS**
Write styles without writing CSS. Use classes like `text-blue-600 p-4` instead.

### **Supabase**
Your database in the cloud. Store user info, posts, anything you want. Free tier available!

### **OpenAI API**
ChatGPT's brain. Call it from your code to add AI powers to your app.

### **Environment Variables** (`.env.local`)
Safe place to store secrets (API keys). Never share these!
